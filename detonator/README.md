# Detonator Project

## Introduction

Hello, we're working on a funny model of a detonator based on Arduino. There are several files.

- The [Main](https://github.com/katseyres/project_detonator/tree/main/Main) folder contains the code (C++). 
- The [Frizting electronic diagram](https://github.com/katseyres/project_detonator/blob/main/electronic_diagram.fzz) and the [pdf](https://github.com/katseyres/project_detonator/blob/main/electronic_diagram.pdf).
- A [Word document](https://github.com/katseyres/project_detonator/blob/main/project_description.docx) in french describes the project process.

## Let's describe the project with an example

- The *LCD screen* asks to encode the password.
- I enter the password.
- If the password is correct, the system needs that I switch on the switch. Otherwise, it displays the password is incorrect.
- Once the switch got turned on, the countdown start from 9 to 0.
- At 0, the bomb exploses.

## List of components
